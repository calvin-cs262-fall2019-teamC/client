We are creating an app to help individuals living with autism de-stim and calm down in situations in which a sensory room is either not provided, expensive, far away, or otherwise inaccessible. Over stimulation can cause a stim or "the repetition of physical movements, sounds, or words." These actions range from simple pacing to violent yelling. Each individual is unique in the ways that are most effective in calming them down. Some individuals are "hyper-sensitive" (are highly sensitive to stimuli) while others are "hypo-sensitive" (desire physical sensation), and others exhibit qualities of both groups. In order to address these different sensitivities and bring individuals back to "sensory regulation," some activities we are considering are: basic drawing functionality, instrumental music/background noises, digital fidget cube, and story reading/illustration. The app will store favorite activities in hopes of customizing the user experience. The application will be developed in Android due to its API for vibration and other potentially useful features and long standing status as a widely utilized platform allowing for flexibility with a range of features and ease of testing.
